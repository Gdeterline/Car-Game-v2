## Adding a second player

Restructured code in order to add a second car controlled by a second player (same keyboard).
Modified physics, with some of them making more sense.
Collisions are finished. Both between cars and car and "wall" (out of the racetrack)
Added a menu which works well. Need to work on initial car position depending on the racetrack in order to be able to count laps. May have some restructuring to do
